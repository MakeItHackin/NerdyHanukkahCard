# Nerdy Hanukkah Card

Welcome Nerds and Happy Hanukkah!  You are probably visiting this page because some awesome person gave you a Nerdy Hanukkah Card :) 
Use the switch to turn on your Nerdy Hanukkah Card.  It will display "Happy Hanukkah!" (or a custom message if ordered) and play Hanukkah O Hannukah.  Next, "May Your Candles Burn Long and Bright" (or 2nd custom message if ordered) and Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel will play.  After the messages and songs complete, the main menu will appear.  There are two apps: Menorah and Dreidel.  The Menorah allows you to light from zero to eight candles.  The candles flicker and the two custom or default messages will alternate every minute.  The Dreidel simulates a random spin of a dreidel and will display either Nun, Gimel, Hay, or Shin.  

You can also write the name of the special person on the back as well as the date.  A fine tip sharpie marker works best.  

Please review the instructions for inserting the battery.  

PLEASE WATCH THE VIDEO DEMONSTRATION AS IT WILL SHOW EVERY FEATURE AND FUNCTION OF THE CARD.  
YOU CAN SKIP MESSAGES AND SONGS BY HOLDING DOWN THE BUTTON WHILE POWERING ON!
